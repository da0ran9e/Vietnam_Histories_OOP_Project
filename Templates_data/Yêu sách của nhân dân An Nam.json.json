We count on your kindness to honor our appeal by your support whenever the opportunity arises. We beg your Excellency graciously to accept the expression of our profound respect.\n\nSince the victory of the allies, all subject peoples are frantic with hope at the prospect of an era of right and justice which should begin for them by virtue of the formal and solemn engagements, made before the whole world by the various powers and the entente in the struggle of civilization against barbarism.\n\nWhile waiting for the principle of national self-determination to pass from ideal to reality through the effective recognition of the sacred right of all peoples to decide their own destiny, the inhabitants of the ancient Empire of Annam, at the present time French Indochina, present to the noble Governments of the entente in general and the honorable French Government the following humble claims:\n\n1) General amnesty for all native people who have been condemned for political activity.\n\n2) Reform of the Indochinese justice system by granting to the native population the same judicial guarantees as the Europeans have and the total suppression of the special courts which are the instruments of terrorization and oppression against the most responsible elements of the Annamite people.\n\n3) Freedom of Press.\n\n4) Freedom to associate freely.\n\n5) Freedom to emigrate and to travel abroad.\n\n6) Freedom of education, and creation in every province of technical and professional schools for the native population.\n\n7) Replacement of the regime of arbitrary decrees by a regime of law.\n\n8) A permanent delegation of native people elected to attend the French parliament in order to keep the latter informed of their needs.\n\nFor the Group of Annamite Patriots\n\n[Signed] Nguyen Ai Quoc\n\n56, rue Monsieur le Prince-Paris}}","{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105143948/http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/projects/casemethod/beamish.html |date=2007-11-05 }}","{{Chú thích web |url=http://hanoi.vnn.vn/chuyen_de/1905/chuyen/bai02.asp |ngày truy cập=2007-09-11 |tựa đề=LÒNG YÊU NƯỚC, ÁNH SÁNG VÀ TINH THẦN QUỐC TẾ |archive-date=2007-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014071201/http://hanoi.vnn.vn/chuyen_de/1905/chuyen/bai02.asp }}","{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105143948/http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/projects/casemethod/beamish.html |date=2007-11-05 }}","{{Tham khảo|30em}}","{{wikisource|Yêu sách của nhân dân An Nam}}","{{Liên kết hỏng|date=2021-05-31 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}","{{Hồ Chí Minh}}"]}

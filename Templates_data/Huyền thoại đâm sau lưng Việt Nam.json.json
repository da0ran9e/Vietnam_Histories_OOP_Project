The stab-in-the-back legend displays classic characteristics of what psychologists call in-group/out-group bias, in which every action by an in-group is rationalized and justified whereas every action by an out-group is criticized and seen as inspired by perverse motives. Through this pattern of thought, the 'stab-in-the-back' interpretation externalizes blame for U.S. defeat entirely to civilian policymakers. A virtuous and effective military had its hands tied by villainous civilians who, pandering to base political instincts, betrayed the soldiers (and eventually South Vietnam) by failing to allow them to do what was needed to win.|doi-access=free }}","{{chú thích sách |last1=Kimball |first1=Jeffrey |editor1-last=Macleod |editor1-first=Jenny |title=Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era |url=https://archive.org/details/defeatmemorycult1815macl |date=2008 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-51740-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/defeatmemorycult1815macl/page/n243 233]\u2013250 |language=en |chapter=The Enduring Paradigm of the \u2018Lost Cause\u2019: Defeat in Vietnam, the Stab-in-the-Back Legend, and the Construction of a Myth}}","{{chú thích tạp chí |last1=Strassfeld |first1=Robert |title='Lose in Vietnam, Bring Our Boys Home' |journal=North Carolina Law Review |date=2004 |volume=82 |page=1916 |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/faculty_publications/267/|quote=Finally, the Administration suggested a  stab-in-the-back theory of the war.
